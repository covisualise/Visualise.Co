<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm <strong>Ankur Yadav</strong>, an 18-year-old passionate video editor who started this creative journey at just 14. What began as a hobby on a smartphone quickly turned into a serious pursuit. With each project, I pushed my limits—freelancing to save up and slowly upgrading my gear from a tablet to a basic PC, then to a Mac, and now working on a full-fledged editing setup. Over the years, I've built solid expertise in industry-standard tools like <strong>Adobe After Effects</strong>, <strong>Premiere Pro</strong>, <strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong>, and <strong>Photoshop</strong>. Whether it's crafting cinematic sequences, editing vlogs, or creating visually compelling reels, I bring a mix of technical skill and creative vision to every frame. From basic cuts to advanced motion graphics, I understand how to tell a story through visuals and sound. I'm always learning, experimenting, and leveling up—because for me, video editing is not just a profession, it's a passion.</p>
